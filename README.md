# imagekernels
This is an extension of the excel spreadsheet used in the fast.ai course. This shows how the image kernels work and extend it to develop Convolution Neural Network.

I added the following features into the original spreadsheet:
* Visualization of the Image Kernels
* Visualization of the calculations involved in a Convolution Neural Network.
* Added the MNIST Dataset for the visualization.
